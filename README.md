# YXX
YAML <-> XML eXchange  
Not to be confused with *Abbotsford International Airport*

This repository describes a method to map a YAML structure to an XML one. The idea behind YXX is that humans don't need to write XML for systems which require them.

## Libraries for different languages

These are only reference implementations for using YXX immediately, they might not be the highest quality of code in their respective language, or the reader might disagree with the specific parsers being used (if the standard library of the language doesn't provide one). In those cases it is an excercise for the reader to implement YXX regarding their own needs, all of these libraries are pretty small
