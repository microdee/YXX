# YXX C++ converter

> [!WARNING]
> This library is not finished yet and will not function. DO NOT USE.

Static library. Use it with XMake or CMake (generated by XMake).

Depends on:

- yaml-cpp
- pugixml

(taken care of by XMake or generated CMakeLists.txt)

Also depends on STL. Strings are handled in `UTF-8` in `std::string`. C++ 20 is recommended for easier syntax, but `yxx.h` is compatible with C++ 11.
